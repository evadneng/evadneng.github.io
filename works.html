	  <h1>What I Have Made</h1>
	  <h4><i>a collection of my past projects!</i></h4>
	  
	  <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
	  <img src="file:///C:\Users\USER\Desktop\portfolio\images\start_cover.png"><img src="file:///C:\Users\USER\Desktop\portfolio\images\end_cover.png">
      <p> Above are the covers I made for a 28-page zine we had to create for our finals in MMTYPOG. The concept is revolves around the reason for living, which in this case, covers different art and the like. The baseline would be that: <i>Art is the reason for living, at least for artists. </i></p>

	  <img src="file:///C:\Users\USER\Desktop\portfolio\images\graphic_article.png"> 	  
	  <p> A graphic spread that could be found within the 28-page zine. The article is written by a classmate of mine in MMTYPOG. We then had to create a whole spread that correlated and showcased our classmate's featured article.</p>
	  
	  <img src="file:///C:\Users\USER\Desktop\portfolio\images\advocacy_poster.png"> 
	  <p> A poster that I made based on my chosen advocacyâ€” in this case, the importance of consent. This poster was made for our MMTYPOG class.</p>
	  
	  <img src="file:///C:\Users\USER\Desktop\portfolio\images\magnum.png">
	  <p> A poster for MAGNUM we made for our MWRITNM class. We were tasked to create a tagline and advertisement line for the chosen product. </p>
